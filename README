An addon plugin for vimscript#3465 using [phpctags](https://github.com/techlivezheng/phpctags) to generate php ctags index.

Provide a much better PHP syntax outline support than the orginal ctags. Methods and properties even local variables assigned in functions are list in their own scope.

Location of phpctags should be in system '$PATH' environment variable.

Or, the locateion of phpctags can be configured in vimrc as such:

let g:tagbar_phpctags_bin='PATH_TO_phpctags'
